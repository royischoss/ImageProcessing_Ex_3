Question1 - 
We want to multiply each level by it coefficient so we could
control what percentage of the level we want to include.
for example with the blending we creates a mask and than by 
creating a gausian pyramid we control the blend.
we multiply each pyramid with coefficient so we include a bit of 
color of the picture whch is not in the mask so it will be smoother.
so the coefficient helps us to control the smooth passing between
the two picture.
