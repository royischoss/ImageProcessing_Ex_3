Question 3- 
The more levels of pyramid we have the bigger the blur
is in the high levels so we get a good passing between 
the photos (not sharp) but similar to getting the filter 
size bigger we can get a mixture of things we didn't wanted to 
change color as affect of the blur.
In addition with every we go higher we can pick the frenquencies
better meaning the band pass get realy thin and we can get 
to a situation where each level in the laplacian hold few frenquencies.
so the control we have on the blend frenquencies is higher.
